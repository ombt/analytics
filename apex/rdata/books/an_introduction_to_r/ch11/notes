statistical models -

The class of generalized linear models handled by facilities supplied in R
includes gaussian, binomial, poisson, inverse gaussian and gamma response
distributions and also quasi-likelihood models where the response distribution
is not explicitly specified. In the latter case the variance function must be
specified as a function of the mean, but in other cases this function is
implied by the response distribution.
