probability distributions -

1) One convenient use of R is to provide a comprehensive set of statistical 
tables. Functions are provided to evaluate the cumulative distribution 
function P(X <= x), the probability density function and the quantile 
function (given q, the smallest x such that P(X <= x) > q), and to
simulate from the distribution.

Distribution 	R name 			additional arguments

beta 		beta			shape1, shape2, ncp
binomial	binom			size, prob
Cauchy 		cauchy 			location, scale
chi-squared 	chisq 			df, ncp
exponential exp rate
F 		f 			df1, df2, ncp
gamma 		gamma 			shape, scale
geometric 	geom 			prob
hypergeometric 	hyper 			m, n, k
log-normal 	lnorm 			meanlog, sdlog
logistic 	logis 			location, scale
negative 	binomial 		nbinom size, prob
normal 		norm 			mean, sd
Poisson 	pois 			lambda
signed 		rank 			signrank n
Student’s t 	t 			df, ncp
uniform 	unif 			min, max
Weibull 	weibull 		shape, scale
Wilcoxon 	wilcox 			m, n

Prefix the name given here by ‘d’ for the density, ‘p’ for the CDF, ‘q’ for the
quantile function and ‘r’ for simulation (random deviates). The first argument
is x for dxxx, q for pxxx, p for qxxx and n for rxxx (except for rhyper,
rsignrank and rwilcox, for which it is nn). In not quite all cases is the
non-centrality parameter ncp currently available: see the on-line help for
details.

The pxxx and qxxx functions all have logical arguments lower.tail and 
log.p and the dxxx ones have log. This allows, e.g., getting the 
cumulative (or “integrated”) hazard function,

H(t) = -log(1 - F(t)), by

- pxxx(t, ..., lower.tail = FALSE, log.p = TRUE)

or more accurate log-likelihoods (by dxxx(..., log = TRUE)), directly.
