1) ordered and unordered factors

A factor is a vector object used to specify a discrete classification 
(grouping) of the components of other vectors of the same length. 

R provides both ordered and unordered factors.

2) using factors and levels to calculate statistics for all values per
level.

create state vector:

> state <- c("tas", "sa", "qld", "nsw", "nsw", "nt", "wa", "wa",
+ "qld", "vic", "nsw", "vic", "qld", "qld", "sa", "tas",
+ "sa", "nt", "wa", "vic", "qld", "nsw", "nsw", "wa",
+ "sa", "act", "nsw", "vic", "vic", "act")
> state
 [1] "tas" "sa"  "qld" "nsw" "nsw" "nt"  "wa"  "wa"  "qld" "vic" "nsw" "vic"
[13] "qld" "qld" "sa"  "tas" "sa"  "nt"  "wa"  "vic" "qld" "nsw" "nsw" "wa"
[25] "sa"  "act" "nsw" "vic" "vic" "act"

create a factor for the state vector.

> statef <- factor(state)
> statef
 [1] tas sa  qld nsw nsw nt  wa  wa  qld vic nsw vic qld qld sa  tas sa  nt  wa
[20] vic qld nsw nsw wa  sa  act nsw vic vic act
Levels: act nsw nt qld sa tas vic wa

> levels(statef)
[1] "act" "nsw" "nt"  "qld" "sa"  "tas" "vic" "wa"

create an array of incomes per state.

> incomes <- c(60, 49, 40, 61, 64, 60, 59, 54, 62, 69, 70, 42, 56,
+ 61, 61, 61, 58, 51, 48, 65, 49, 49, 41, 48, 52, 46,
+ 59, 46, 58, 43)

get the mean per state of all the incomes for that state.

> incmeans <- tapply(incomes, statef, mean)
> incmeans
     act      nsw       nt      qld       sa      tas      vic       wa
44.50000 57.33333 55.50000 53.60000 55.00000 60.50000 56.00000 52.25000

define a function to get the standard deviation and apply to 
the same data.

> stdError <- function(x) sqrt(var(x)/length(x))
> incster <- tapply(incomes, statef, stdError)
> incster
     act      nsw       nt      qld       sa      tas      vic       wa
1.500000 4.310195 4.500000 4.106093 2.738613 0.500000 5.244044 2.657536

3) The combination of a vector and a labelling factor is an example of 
what is sometimes called a ragged array, since the subclass sizes 
are possibly irregular. When the subclass sizes are all the same the 
indexing may be done implicitly and much more efficiently, as we see 
in the next section.

4) ordered factors -

The levels of factors are stored in alphabetical order, or in the order they
were specified to factor if they were specified explicitly.

Sometimes the levels will have a natural ordering that we want to record and
want our statistical analysis to make use of. The ordered() function creates
such ordered factors but is otherwise identical to factor. For most purposes
the only difference between ordered and unordered factors is that the former
are printed showing the ordering of the levels, but the contrasts generated for
them in fitting linear models are different
