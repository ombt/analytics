default startup files for Rstudio:

-- /cygdrive/c/./cygwin64/lib/R/library/base/R/Rprofile
-- /cygdrive/c/./Program Files/R/R-3.4.3/etc/Rprofile.site
-- /cygdrive/c/./Program Files/R/R-3.4.3/library/base/R/Rprofile

this is the file that RStudio reads when it comes up.
you can reset the startup directory in this file.
